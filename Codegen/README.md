# Swift scripting

Apollo Client for iOS enables us to use Swift scripting to perform certain operations that otherwise require the command line. 

We are using Apolloâ€™s beta code generation tool to :
- Download a schema ;
- Generate Swift code for the model object based on the schema and operations.

The official documentation can be found [at this link](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/swift-scripting/).

The `Target` folder contains the generated files and the schema.
