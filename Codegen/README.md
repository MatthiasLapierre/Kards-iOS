# Swift scripting

Apollo Client for iOS enables us to use Swift scripting to perform certain operations that otherwise require the command line. 
We are using Apolloâ€™s beta code generation tool to :
- Download a schema
- Generate Swift code for our model object based on your schema and operations
The official documentation can be found [at this link](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/swift-scripting/)
The `output` folder contains the generated files.
