Kards is a free-to-play World War II-themed online digital collectible card game developed and published by 1939 Games. It was released in early access on Steam on April 12, 2019 and was fully released on April 15, 2020. Mobile ports are expected to be released in 2021 with crossplay capabilities between platforms.

## Gameplay

Kards is a turned-based collectible card game. It is played between two players, each with a deck of 40 cards themed around strategies of powers during World War II: Nazi Germany, Great Britain, Soviet Union, the United States, Imperial Japan, France, and Fascist Italy. For example, a German deck relies on Blitzkrieg to overwhelm the opponent with tanks. The objective is to destroy the enemy's headquarters represented by a card on the board.

The playing field, called "battlefield" in-game, is divided into three fronts, the player's support line, front line, and the enemy's support line. The support and front line can hold up to four and five cards respectively, but units must be deployed in the player's support line when played. In order to play cards, players expend a resource called Kredit that refreshes every turn, after which the maximum Kredit increases by one, up to 12. Kredits can also be used to move military units to the front line or to attack enemy units. Once a unit has been moved to the front line, they cannot retreat back unless forced to by certain cards. The front line can only be controlled by one player at a time, as such, whoever controls it has a strategic advantage on the battlefield.

### Game modes

Players can compete against a computer AI or against human opponents online based on a tiered-ranking system. Players' rank will reset after each one-month long season. Alternatively, players can play in a draft against other human players where they have to build a deck from scratch by picking one card out of three randomly chosen ones at a time, after which they will use it until they win or lose a certain number of matches, earning rewards based on their performance.

There is also five single-player campaigns that players can progress through, each themed around major military campaigns from the war.


## Development

__Kards__ runs on iOS 14.0 and greater. It uses SwiftUI,  Combine and GraphQL extensively.
